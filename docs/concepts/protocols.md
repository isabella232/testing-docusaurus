RabbitMQ natively supports AMQP 0.9.1 but also can be configured to support extra protocols:

- MQTT
- STOMP
- AMQP 1.0

## MQTT

MQTT is a publish-subscribe messaging protocol used commonly in IOT.

- Clients can publish messages to topics on a broker.
- Clients can subscribe to individual topics or a hierarchy of topics.
- Supports three levels of delivery guarantee (QoS) scoped to publisher-broker and broker-consumer:
  - QoS 0: At-Most-Once delivery (messages can be lost)
  - QoS 1: At-Least-Once delivery (messages cannot be lost, but can be delivered more than once)
  - QoS 2: Exactly-Once (messages are delivered exactly once)

Exactly-Once only makes guarantees about delivery from publisher to broker, and broker to consumer. It does not prevent:

- a broker from losing the message. It is up to the broker to implement message replication or the server administrator to provide redundant storage.
- a consumer using a different QoS less strong than Exactly-Once. 

RabbitMQ supports all MQTT 3.1 features except for QoS 2 for consumers. It does however provide the ability to use replicated queues providing high availability and data safety.

## STOMP

STOMP stands for Simple (or Streaming) Text Orientated Messaging Protocol. It is a text based publish-subscribe messaging protocol that is designed to be simple and lightweight.

Clients (both publishers and subscribers) open long lived connections to a broker. Messages are published to **destinations** and consumers subscribe to **destinations**. It does not include any message durability and persistence features in the protocol itself and the RabbitMQ implementation relies on the usual durability guarantees you get with any queue.

RabbitMQ offers many different ways to map STOMP destinations onto RabbitMQ exchanges and queues. Two plugins are provided.

### Web STOMP plugin (STOMP over WebSocket)

Provides for support for STOMP over WebSocket to allow for browser to broker communications.

## AMQP 1.0

AMQP 1.0 is a completely different protocol to AMQP 0.9.1 and should be considered separate protocols. AMQP 1.0 has wide support in various messaging systems, including RabbitMQ. However, RabbitMQ supports only a subset of the full protocol.

This [YouTube this video series from Microsoft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODpeIdUdClc) as a good AMQP 1.0 primer.

Read on to learn about the differences between AMQP 0.9.1 and AMQP 1.0.

### Peer-to-peer (1.0) vs Broker Based (0.9.1)

AMQP 1.0 is a peer-to-peer protocol, it does not include the concept of a broker. Therefore it does not natively include routing, publish-subscribe or message durability. Despite not being a part of the protocol, typically AMQP 1.0 is used in a broker based system where one endpoint is a broker and the other an application. Through broker implementations you typically get publish-subscribe features.

AMQP 0.9.1 is an overtly broker-based protocol with native support for routing and publish-subscribe.

### Connection Concepts and Flow Control

AMQP 1.0 has a more complex set of concepts including connections, channels, sessions, nodes and links. It has two levels of flow control (session level and link level) to prevent system resources being used up and to throttle fast publishers.

AMQP 0.9.1 has a model of connections, channels, exchanges and queues. Flow control exists at three levels: the connection, channel and queue level. Addtionally, consumers can perform flow control by the use of prefetch and acknowledgements.

### On the wire format

AMQP 1.0 has a more complex on the wire binary format more similar to something like Avro, ProtoBuf or Thrift. AMQP 0.9.1 simply stores bytes as the publisher provides.

title: We love Free Software!
author: Jean-Sébastien Pédron

The RabbitMQ project and team relies a **lot** on Free and Open Source
Software! From [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/), the programming
language RabbitMQ is written in to [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/),
the static website generator, to [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [GNU
Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and all the tools that make
our developers' life as seemless as possible.

A huge Thank you to all the amazing people behind those projects!

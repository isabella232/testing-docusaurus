title: Moving website to Docusaurus

We finally moved from a home-grown website almost-static engine to an
open-source generator called [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

We are happy with the change!

It even supports Erlang hilighting:

```erlang
hello_world() ->
    io:format("Hello World!~n").
```
